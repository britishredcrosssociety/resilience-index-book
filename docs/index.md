# Welcome {.unnumbered}

<img src="images/cover/cover.png" class="cover" width="250" height="250"/> This
book contains the long-form documentation of the British Red Cross [Resilience
Index](https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/resilience-index). It is a
work in progress, and is intended for a late 2022 release.

The book starts at Chapter \@ref(overview) with a top-level overview of the
Resilience Index. If you only have time to read one chapter, make it this. This
chapter should equip you with enough knowledge to broadly understand *what* the
Resilience Index covers, *where* it covers, and *how* to interact with and
interpret the outputs. Later chapters go into more depth about the methods and
data sources used to build the index and are aimed at a technical audience.

## License {.unnumbered}
The license of the Resilience Index can be found in the
[LICENSE](https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/resilience-index/blob/main/LICENSE)
file of the GitHub repository that hosts the code and data.
