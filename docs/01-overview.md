# Overview {#overview}

## Introduction

### What does it do?
The Resilience Index **maps** Local Authorities based on potential **need for support** (vulnerability) and **capacity** to meet that need.

### What is covered
There are **three** indices, one of each of the British Red Cross 2030 **Strategic Causes**: (1.) health inequalities; (2.) Disasters & Emergencies; (3.) Displacement & Migration.

### Where is covered?
The Resilience Index maps **Local Authorities** in each of the four devolved nations across the **UK**.

## Output (Maps)

- **Twelve** maps/scores in total. **Three** indices, across **four** nations.
- Each map is specific to a single cause and nation and presents a resilience score:

## Output (Tables)

- Data tables will also be available with indicator scores, domain scores, vulnerability & capacity scores, and overall resilience scores:

## Calculating Resilience

- **Indicators** are combined to **form domain**s, which are **then combined to** form capacity & vulnerability **scores**, which are then compared side-by-side to form a resilience score.

## FAQ

### Does the Resilience Index replace the COVID-19 Vulnerability Index?
No. The indices cover different needs. The COVID-19 VI is specific to
COVID-19 only.

### Can the indices of each nation be compared side by side?
No. They are designed to be viewed independently.

## Status

- The Resilience Index is currently under active development, and only exists in a limited capacity at this time. Check the metadata files in `/R` to see the progress of each cause in each nation.
