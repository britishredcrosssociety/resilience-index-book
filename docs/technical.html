</h3>
<p>There are additional complexities for the indicator data used within the capacity section of the health index for England. This is due to the fact that most of the data available was at NHS Trust level but the desired outcome of the index is at Local Authority Districts (i.e. Local Tier Local Authorities). NHS Trusts are not coterminous to LADs (or UTLAs, MSOA or LSOA etc.) or vice versa.</p>
<div id="public-health-england-catchment-calculations" class="section level5" number="3.6.1.0.1">
<h5>
<span class="header-section-number">3.6.1.0.1</span> Public Health England catchment calculations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#public-health-england-catchment-calculations"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h5>
<p>Public Health England (PHE) have collected data on the number of patients (elective and emergency) who are admitted from a Middle Super Output Area (MSOA) to a given NHS Trust, and also the number of people from a MSOA to any provider. This gives the proportion of the MSOA patients at each Trust.<a href="https://app.box.com/s/qh8gzpzeo1firv1ezfxx2e6c4tgtrudl">1</a></p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/technical/aggregation_techniques/msoa_split_by_trusts.png"></div>
<p>These proportions were multiplied by the MSOA population (from ONS population numbers) to give the MSOA catchment population for a provider, and then these MSOA catchments were summed across each Trust to give a Trust catchment population.<a href="https://app.box.com/s/qh8gzpzeo1firv1ezfxx2e6c4tgtrudl">1</a> In the above example if the MSOA population is 1,000 then the estimated catchment for Trust A for MSOA 1 is 400 people.</p>
<p>Note that in the data the porportions don’t always sum to 100% when summed across each MSOA. Contacting PHE to enquire about this.</p>
<p>Since have both the Trust catchment population and the MSOA catchments for a Trust can estimate the split of Trust population by MSOAs.</p>
<p>This data can be used to <strong>estimate</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>MSOA population proportioned to Trusts</li>
<li>Trust population proportioned to MSOAs</li>
</ul>
<p>MSOAs are coterminous to LADs and so can be aggregated and so the above can also be <strong>estimated</strong> for LADs. This estimation method leads to the proportions summing to 100% for a given LAD.</p>
<p>It is important to note this method is an estimate and is based on a sample of data.</p>
<p>Also important to note that the data only includes acute Trusts and so does not have information on non-acute trusts such as community and mental health providers. Some of the indicators had data from these kind of Trusts and it was not possible at this time to attribute this information across LADs and therefore was not possible to add this to the index with this current method.</p>

</h4>
<p>Trust codes can change because Trusts can combine and disaggregate over time.</p>
<p>The geographr package <a href="https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/geographr">2</a> has a script which deals with updating trust codes <a href="https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/geographr/blob/main/data-raw/lookup_trust_msoa.R">here</a>. This logic was used in the <em>‘trust_changes.R’</em> file to create <em>‘trust_changes.feather’</em> dataset which could be used to check changes in Trust codes.</p>
<p>Checks were done to see if any Trust codes were found in the PHE England catchment calculations but not in the trusts defined as open in the geographr package <a href="https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/geographr/blob/main/data-raw/points_nhs_trusts.R">3</a> and vice versa <a href="https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/resilience-index/blob/28763b0fa47e4c02bc945950f39e8696f831fd52/R/capacity/health-inequalities/england/trust_types/trust_msoa_lad_catchments.R#L48">here</a>. Any changes were updated in the PHE England catchment calculations and saved as <em>lookup_trust_lad.feather</em>.</p>

<p>Indicators which were dealt with using the following method:</p>
<ul>
<li>CQC ratings</li>
<li>CQC survey scores</li>
<li>SHMI deaths</li>
<li>% of vacancies in Adult Social Care</li>
</ul>
<p>The LAD population proportioned to Trusts was used to do a weighted average of these indicators.</p>
<p>For example if for LAD 1, 40% of the population is attributed to Trust A (which has a rating of 2) and 60% is attributed to Trust B (which has a rating of 4) then the weighted rating for LAD 1 is 0.4 * 2 + 0.6 * 4 = 3.2.</p>

</h5>
<p>For the SHMI data only acute non-specialists trusts report this data and so the weights were re-calcated to give the proportion based on acute non-specialist patients. In the example below Trust D is a specialist trust and therefore does not report on SHMI</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/technical/aggregation_techniques/trust_not_reporting.png"></div>

<p>Indicators which were dealt with using the following method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Count of available beds</li>
<li>Count of people on waiting list over 13 weeks (and count on waiting list)</li>
<li>Count of people waiting more than 4 hours in A&amp;E (and count of all waiting in A&amp;E)</li>
<li>Count of full time equivalent NHS staff</li>
<li>Cost (£) of high risk backlog maintenance</li>
</ul>
<p>These count values for a given Trust were attributed across the LADs. This follows logic used by Colin Angus using the PHE catchment calculation data. <a href="https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/5803fa341b3af99e7a8d8b4eda708e6a3d2ab052/Heatmaps/COVIDAdmissionsLTLAPhasePlot.R#L73">2</a></p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/technical/aggregation_techniques/trusts_split_by_lad.png"></div>
<p>If the count of available beds for Trust A is 400 then this is attributed as 20 (5% * 400) to LAD 1 and so on. This is repeated for all Trusts and then the attributions are summed across each LAD to give the estimated total number of available beds for each LAD.</p>
<p>For the following indictors this value was then normalised by the MSOA population:</p>
<ul>
<li>Count of available beds</li>
<li>Count of full time equivalent NHS staff</li>
<li>Cost (£) of high risk backlog maintenance</li>
</ul>
<p>For the following indictors this value was then normalised by a denominator that was also attributed from Trust to LAD using the same method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Count of people on waiting list over 13 weeks (divided by total number in waiting list)</li>
<li>Count of people waiting more than 4 hours in A&amp;E (divided by total number in A&amp;E).</li>
</ul>

</h4>
<p>As mentioned <a href="technical.html#dealing-with-changes-in-trust-codes">above</a> there was the challenge of changing Trust codes between the open trusts in geographr package, the PHE England catchment data and sometimes the indicator data (depending on the date of the data).</p>
<p>In the following indicators had to deal with trust code changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of available beds</li>
<li>CQC survey scores</li>
</ul>
<p>If updating the index in the future will need to check where cases the indicator data trusts codes don’t align with what is in the PHE England catchment calculations and use lookups to deal with these cases so able to join and attribute the data back to LADs.</p>

</h4>
<p>There are 14 trusts that as of May 2019 don’t need to report on the A&amp;E waiting times (see page 3 <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Statistical-commentary-November-2021-jf8.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/News/fourteen-hospitals-chosen-to-pilot-new-ae-targets">here</a>). However they do still report on the total number of people in A&amp;E.</p>
<p>The following imputation method was used to estimate the % of those waiting longer than 4 hours:</p>
<ul>
<li>Took the % who waited over 4 hours for each of the 14 Trusts based on the last available data (April 2019).</li>
<li>Calculated the median change in this proportion between April 2019 and the current data for all other Trusts that continued to report.</li>
<li>Applied this median change to the April 2019 proportions for these 14 trusts.</li>
<li>Applied this estimated proportion to the total number of people in A&amp;E to estimate the number of people waiting over 4 hours.</li>
</ul>

</h4>
<p>5 open trusts did not have A&amp;E waiting times data due to them being specalist and so potentially not having an A&amp;E service. For this a similar approach of re-calculating proportions as <a href="#dealing-with-not-all-trusts-providing-data">here</a> was taken.</p>

<p>For the CQC survey indicator there were different surveys for different services. Some were dated 2020 and therefore included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adult inpatient</li>
<li>Urgent &amp; emergency care</li>
<li>Community mental health</li>
</ul>
<p>COVID inpatient survey was dated 2020 but was not broken down by Trust.</p>
<p>As of Nov 2021 there were other service curveys that further in past (and so not included, however they are scheduled for updated data and so may look to be included in updated of the RI):</p>
<ul>
<li>Maternity (2019)</li>
<li>Children &amp; young people (2018)</li>
<li>Ambulance (2013/14)</li>
<li>Outpatient (2011)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the surveys taken these were averaged, weighted by the number of responders of each of the services (noting these weightings may not be reflective of the respective sizes of the services provided by each Trust). Some of the Trusts had no survey responses, as they may not have provided the services asked about in the surveys.
