# Overview {#overview}

## Introduction

### What does it do?
The Resilience Index **maps** Local Authorities based on potential **need for support** (vulnerability) and **capacity** to meet that need.

### What is covered
There are **two** indices, based on the British Red Cross's **strategic causes**:

- Disasters & Emergencies
- Health Inequalities

We are not developing a Resilience Index for Displacement & Migration, due to the sensitive nature of asylum and resettlement data. Instead, we are producing bespoke analyses to inform this strategic cause.

### Where is covered?
The Resilience Index maps **Local Authorities** in each of the four devolved nations across the **UK**.

## Output (Maps)

- **Eight** maps in total, comprised of **two** indices, across **four** nations.
- Each map is specific to a single strategic cause and nation and presents a resilience score:

## Output (Data tables)

- Data tables will also be available with indicator scores, domain scores, vulnerability & capacity scores, and overall resilience scores:

## Calculating Resilience

- **Indicators** are combined to **form domain**s, which are **then combined to** form capacity & vulnerability **scores**, which are then compared side-by-side to form a resilience score.

## FAQ

### Does the Resilience Index replace the COVID-19 Vulnerability Index?
No. The indices cover different needs. The COVID-19 VI is specific to
COVID-19 only.

### Can the indices of each nation be compared side by side?
No. They are designed to be viewed independently.

## Status

- The Resilience Index is currently under active development, and only exists in a limited capacity at this time. Check the metadata files in `/R` to see the progress of each cause in each nation.
